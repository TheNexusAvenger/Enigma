**When posting that trackers aren't working**, please also include:
- The result of `enigma-cli.exe list-devices --masked` run from a command prompt
  or terminal.
- *When using with Nexus VR Character Model*, a screenshot of the Enigma window
  in the Nexus VR Character Model menu. It should say that the data transfer is
  active to be working.

**When posting about experience-specific or project-specific issue** (except for
trackers not being detected in Nexus VR Character Model), please report the issue
to the downstream problem before creating a GitHub Issue. Enigma has known
experience-specific and project-specific compatibility issues.
